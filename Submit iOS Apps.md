It might take about one to three days to obtain the approval from the App Store, and upto 24 hours for your app being appeared.

If your app rejected, you will have to make the necessary edits and submit again for review. The most common reasons for rejections from the Apple App Store are lack of accurate information and the performance of the app. Therefore, make sure that your app is complete and smart.
